This repository is a record of my progress working through the
[rosalind.info](https://rosalind.info) problem set.

I'm hoping to make it through all 284 problems (as of 2022-02-22).

The most important file for other people browsing may be `start_problem.py`.

`start_problem.py` is a helper CLI program that automatically pulls down
the core rosalind problem text, creates a boilerplated template containing
documentation and evaluation information, and organizes it into a file
structure.

Feel free to use it if it also helps you cut down on the code boilerplate for
neatly solving each problem and allow you to focus most of your effort on
implementation.
